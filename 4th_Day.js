 Day 4 part 1
 To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.
 For example:

 aa bb cc dd ee is valid.
 aa bb cc dd aa is not valid - the word aa appears more than once.
 aa bb cc dd aaa is valid - aa and aaa count as different words.
 The system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input. How many passphrases are valid?
